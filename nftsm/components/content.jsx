                        <p>An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>NFTs exist on a blockchain, which is a distributed public ledger that records transactions. Youâ€™re probably most familiar with blockchain as the underlying process that makes cryptocurrencies possible.</p>
